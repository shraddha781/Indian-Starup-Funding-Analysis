# Indian-Starup-Funding-Analysis
🛠 Suggestions for Improvement
1. Handle Duplicates
Add a step to remove duplicates, especially since startup data often has repeated entries:

python
Copy
Edit
df = df.drop_duplicates()
2. Refine 'City/Location' Column
City/location often contains inconsistent entries like "Bangalore / Bengaluru". Normalize them:

python
Copy
Edit
df['city/location'] = df['city/location'].str.strip().str.title().replace({
    'Bangalore': 'Bengaluru',
    'Delhi': 'New Delhi',
    'Mumbai / Pune': 'Mumbai',
    # Add more mappings as needed
})
3. Better Investor Parsing
The investors_name field may contain multiple investors separated by commas. Count each individually for better insights:

python
Copy
Edit
from collections import Counter

investor_list = df['investors_name'].dropna().str.split(', ')
flat_investors = [investor.strip() for sublist in investor_list for investor in sublist]
top_investors = Counter(flat_investors).most_common(10)

investor_df = pd.DataFrame(top_investors, columns=['Investor', 'Count'])
sns.barplot(x='Count', y='Investor', data=investor_df)
plt.title("Top 10 Most Active Investors")
plt.show()
4. Funding Amount Analysis by Sector
Instead of just counts, consider which sectors raised the most money:

python
Copy
Edit
sector_funding = df.groupby('industry_vertical')['amount_in_usd'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)
sns.barplot(x=sector_funding.values, y=sector_funding.index)
plt.title("Top 10 Sectors by Total Funding")
plt.xlabel("Total Funding (USD)")
plt.show()
5. Top Funded Startups (by Amount)
Not just by count, but who raised the most:

python
Copy
Edit
top_funded = df.groupby('startup_name')['amount_in_usd'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)
sns.barplot(x=top_funded.values, y=top_funded.index)
plt.title("Top 10 Startups by Total Funding")
plt.xlabel("Total Funding (USD)")
plt.show()
🧠 Optional Enhancements
Month-over-month or YOY growth rate of funding.

Funding per investor, average deal size.

Interactive visualizations using Plotly or Dash (if sharing with stakeholders).

Export insights to a PDF or Excel file for reporting.

Let me know if you want help implementing any of these suggestions or want to expand this into a report or dashboard.

## 📌 Key Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Load the dataset and inspect data types, null values, and structure.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Standardize column names
   - Convert date columns to datetime format
   - Handle missing values
   - Clean and convert funding amount to numeric

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Funding trends over time
   - Top sectors by funding count and amount
   - Top cities for startup activity
   - Most active investors
   - Most funded startups

4. **Visualizations**
   - Line plots and bar charts to highlight trends and key players

5. **Recommendations**
   - Actionable insights for investors and founders based on data
